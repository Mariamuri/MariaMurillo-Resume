        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Maria Murillo and I am 19 years old. I was born in Chicago, Illinois but was raised in Los Angeles. My whole life when I was younger I expected my job to be at a mall or a retail store for the reason that I always enjoyed going to the stores, especially the mall. At the age of 16 when Covid 19 barely hit I decided to get my first job at Texas Roadhouse this was in the year 2020. Within my time in the restaurant I have been promoted to different positions. I started off in the back doing silverware for about 6 months which consisted of rolling silverware and scooping butters. After 6 months I got moved up to to-go's which was very different compared to what I was doing in the back. I had to carry big heavy trays with one hand which was out of my comfort zone and I doubted myself but I have gotten used to it. Another 6 months later I got moved up to expo which consists of making sure the tables get their food on time and get their orders made correctly. I have been doing expo for a year now and I say I definitely have seen an improvement in the speed I work in. I am a hard working person and am always striving to do better. Since I show that I am hard working the managers expect a lot from me and know I am capable of doing many things. Also, within my time working there I have also trained many people which I would say is my favorite thing to do. I enjoy training people because I get to know them and allow them to feel comfortable in the workspace. Creating interactions with one another is another great thing I enjoy from the workspace since no one is ever being left out. Although I have only been trained to do 3 different positions I have tried a lot of the other positions both in the back of the house and front of the house to help out coworkers. In the back of the house I have done cold prep and meat prep which take up to 8 hours to finish everything that has to be done. The restaurant is extremely known for their warm bread rolls and I have also spent a lot of time baking trying to help out the bakers during busy business hours. Now going to the front of the house I have ran food which consists of walking people's foods to their tables and getting them anything that they need. I also tried bussing and mucking which are related but I enjoy mucking. Now I have been there for over 2 years now and would say that working there has allowed me to learn many new things that I didn't know before both food related and working related. Overall, I am a great team player and hard working individual that is always willing to try and learn new things as a way to improve. <br><br>

        When I got my first job I was a Junior in high school doing school online due to Covid. I had way less responsibilities back then because we weren’t allowed to go out as much at the time due to the virus but after a year when I got to college being able to balance both school and work was challenging. School, specifically college, requires a lot of time and effort and so having the responsibility of having to go into work when I knew I had homework to finish was stressful. I would be drained sometimes from doing both work and school but I needed to do it for myself. Ever since I started to work I saved money for college because I always knew I wanted to go to school and further my career so I got a job for the sake of saving money. I am a second year undeclared student at UCR and am striving to get into dental school. I am a full time college student that spends the majority of their time studying and getting work done. School takes up a lot of my time and getting time for myself is very challenging but I always try to find time for myself because self care is extremely important in keeping a healthy mental health. College is hard and stressful but at the end of the day I remember that all this stress will get the degree that I worked so hard for. I am undecided on what to major in although I know what I want to study for. Since I was a little girl I knew I had an interest in teeth so I originally thought about becoming a dentist but once I got my braces I enjoyed all the science the teeth and how braces work so I changed my mind into becoming an Orthodontist instead which takes a few more years of school. Once I graduate and finish my undergrad I will apply to a dental school which is competitive to get into. I specifically want to go to USC due to their amazing dental program that they offer and I want to take advantage of that. During the time that I have been at UCR I haven’t taken any courses closely related to my desired career and I am hoping to soon take biology classes. As of now I believe majoring in biology is the way to go since it focuses on a lot of things like the body and the mind. I am so impulsive about becoming an Orthodontist that I watch youtube videos of people getting braces or dentist talking about teeth due to the fascination I have for teeth. A lot goes into braces such as how a wire or bracket is positioned in order for it to move in the correct way. Although it will be challenging to get to where I want, I am willing to go through the challenges to accomplish this life goal of mine. <br><br>

        A few months ago I have been calling and looking for Orthodontic offices to work at or shadow at. I am willing to work in the front desk, sanitize the tools, or set up for the dentist. I want to be able to get familiar with how dental offices work and the tools they use. I have been wanting to help out or work at a dental office for a while now but I can’t seem to find a location that is willing to have me. I know a person that works at an Orthodontic office so I will ask her if there is a possibility of me working at a dental office without any dental school while also not being familiar with anything dentistry. Being a shadow at a dentist will be a huge help for my career and success because I will already be familiar with what is being taught. As of now I have also thought about taking an esthetician course to learn how to take care of the skin and do facials or even learn how to do nails or eyelashes. There are many opportunities that are offered to individuals so I want to take advantage of those courses. I want to not only be great at dentistry but I would also enjoy being good at something else. It is a good thing to be able to do many different things because you can come in handy at any moment. If anything, learning how to do eyelashes, nails, hair, etc can also be a hobby and not just a job. There are many things I want to do but the costs are very expensive so I have to watch out with what I want to do and make sure I put no time or money to waste. In the end if I don’t find anything to do while I earn my degree I will probably work more hours at work or volunteer at any open locations around me since I will be able to leave wherever making it more flexible with my schedule. But as of now I have cut off some of my days at work to be able to focus mainly on school due to turning in my assignments on time and to study for quizzes. The reason why I can’t work so much either is because I take up to one day to finish just one assignment due to me overthinking what I write and thinking it is wrong or not good enough but I also take small breaks because I feel like imma go insane if I just sit there for 8 hours straight looking at a screen. Therefore, I need to find hobbies or volunteer places to be at for an hour or something to not get mentally drained with everything. I also don’t want to just sit around and waste my time doing nothing productive or else I will feel bad for the rest of the day for wasting a day in my life when I could’ve been doing something productive.
